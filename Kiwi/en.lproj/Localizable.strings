\
{Governing Law; Arbitration}\
\
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH KIWISWEAT AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM KIWISWEAT.\
\
In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or the Service, you and KiwiSweat agree to consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing your mutual interests, try to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties. If we do not reach settlement within a period of 60 days, then either of us may, by notice to the other demand mediation under the mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association in New York, New York. We both give up our right to litigate our disputes and may not proceed to arbitration without first trying mediation, but you and KiwiSweat are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief from the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and KiwiSweat will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.\
\
If settlement is not reached within 60 days after service of a written demand for mediation, any unresolved controversy or claim will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator in New York, New York. The language of all proceedings and filings will be English. The arbitrator will render a written opinion including findings of fact and law and the award and/or determination of the arbitrator will be binding on the parties, and their respective administrators and assigns, and will not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties will share the expenses of the arbitration equally unless the arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed and the arbitrator may award the prevailing party its attorneys' fees and expenses. It is the intent of the parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within 90 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties. Failure to adhere to this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award. Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.\
\
{General}\
\
Enforcement of these Terms is solely at KiwiSweat's discretion. Failure to enforce any part of these Terms in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the same or other part of these Terms in other instances. If any provision of these Terms is or becomes unlawful, void or otherwise unenforceable (including the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations above), then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect. As used in these Terms, \"including\" means \"including (without limitation).\" The section headings these Terms and are for reference purposes only and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms.\
